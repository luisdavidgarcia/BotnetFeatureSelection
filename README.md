# IoT Intrusion Detection System Performance in Imbalanced Botnet Datasets

This repository contains the research work conducted by Luis David Garcia and Nicholas Zarate. The focus of our study is on enhancing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for the Internet of Things (IoT) by analyzing the impact of dataset imbalance on the efficacy of machine learning models in detecting security threats such as DoS and DDoS attacks.
Abstract

With the increasing adoption of IoT in sectors like energy, healthcare, and automotive, there's a rising productivity coupled with notable security vulnerabilities. Our study explores how the imbalance in datasets affects machine learning model performance in identifying these threats. We apply Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the data and evaluate the performance enhancements in detection models, with the XGBoost model achieving an F1-score of 0.999983 under adjusted distributions.

## Models and Performance

We used the following classifiers in our study:

- XGBoost (XGB)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Logistic Regression (LR)

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [CSE-CIC-IDS2018](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html) dataset, which includes multiple types of malicious attacks. The distribution was adjusted from a 60/40 benign-to-DDoS/DoS split to both 50/50 and 80/20 splits to evaluate the model performance.
Contributions
